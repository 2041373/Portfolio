          <p className="about-subtitle">Hi there! My name is Nazar Zaheer and I'm a recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science. I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, as well as Java. My passion lies in the intersection of technology and security, particularly in cloud and cyber security. I am excited to start my career in this field and use my skills to help companies achieve their security goals. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing chess and exploring new technologies. Let's connect and see how we can work together!</p>
